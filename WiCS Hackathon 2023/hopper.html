            Became one of the first women to earn her Ph.D. in mathematics. Hopper started working at a private company in 1949. She oversaw UNIVAC computer programming while working for Remington Rand. Her team created the first computer language compiler, which functions as a word-to-code translator. The COBOL language was eventually made possible by the compiler. She was the person who coins the term computer bug when moth led to failure on the Mark II computer she was working on.
