Best known for her work with optimizing compilers, Allen had humble beginnings and worked towards paying off her student loan debt. To pay off the debt, Allen worked for Thomas J. Watson Research Center at IBM and taught Fortran to employees. Among her numerous honors are the Ada Lovelace Award from the Association of Women in Computing and the Charles Babbage Award from the IEEE Computer Society. She was the first female to get an IBM fellowship as well as the Turing Award. In her honor, the IBM Ph.D. Fellowship Award was established. Both the IEEE and the Association for Computing Machinery have elected her as a fellow.
